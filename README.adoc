Keywi (speak https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi[Kiwi]) is a master-data-management system that allows you to manage and maintain lists of master-data (key-lists).
This can be things like "countries of the world", "academic titles", etc.
Other applications may use `keywi` as a microservice to integrate such data and let the user choose values from such a key-list using a combobox.
The `keywi` server (backend) is written in Java based on https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/[devon4j] and the client (frontend) is written in TypeScript based on https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng/[devon4ng] (using Angular).
